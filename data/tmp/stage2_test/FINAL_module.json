      "content": "Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited progressive brain disease that causes brain cells, called neurons, to die in various areas of the brain, including those that help to control voluntary (intentional) movement. People are born with the defective gene, but symptoms usually do not appear until middle age. The common age of onset is 35 to 44 years and generally, the duration of the illness ranges from 10 to 30 years.",

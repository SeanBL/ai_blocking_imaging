You are an expert medical editor and instructional designer.

Your task is to extract SEQUENTIAL STEPS from text that has already
been classified as an "engage2" block. ALL paragraphs marked as
"engage2_step" must be processed TOGETHER into one unified sequence.

These paragraphs describe a clear progression, causal chain, or
ordered explanation. Your job is to identify the natural steps in
that progression.

------------------------------------------------------------
STRICT RULES
------------------------------------------------------------

1. SOURCE TEXT ONLY
   - Extract ONLY steps already present in the text.
   - Do NOT invent, merge, or infer new steps.
   - Do NOT reorder steps.
   - Preserve all medically relevant details.

2. STEP EXTRACTION
   - Combine ALL engage2_step paragraphs in their original order.
   - Split the combined material into 2–10 steps IF the text supports it.
   - Each step must be a clean, standalone sentence or sentence fragment.
   - You may lightly adjust grammar for clarity, but you MUST NOT change meaning.

3. LENGTH RULE
   - The ENTIRE Engage2 sequence (all steps combined) must be
     approximately 150 words or fewer.
   - If the combined text cannot reasonably be reduced to 150 words
     WITHOUT removing medical meaning, preserve the meaning and exceed
     150 words only if unavoidable.

4. DO NOT:
   - Do NOT create button labels.
   - Do NOT generate images.
   - Do NOT generate quiz questions.
   - Do NOT reclassify the block.
   - Do NOT remove medically important content.
   - Do NOT include any explanations or markdown.

------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ONLY)
------------------------------------------------------------

You MUST output exactly:

{
  "header": "<header>",
  "engage2_blocks": [
    {
      "paragraph_index": <index of FIRST engage2_step paragraph>,
      "engage2_steps": [
        "<step 1>",
        "<step 2>",
        "<step 3>"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Where:
- header = copied exactly from input
- paragraph_index = the FIRST engage2_step paragraph index from Stage 2A-2
- engage2_steps = ordered steps extracted from ALL step paragraphs combined

Do NOT include any other fields.
Do NOT include comments, metadata, or explanations.

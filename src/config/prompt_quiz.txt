You are generating quiz questions for a medical learning module.
All questions must be based ONLY on the provided text.
You must not add new medical facts or external knowledge.

STRICT RULES:

1. SOURCE TEXT ONLY
   - Every question must be supported directly by a sentence in the provided text.
   - No new facts. No inferred facts.

2. TYPES OF QUESTIONS
   - Use a mix of SINGLE-ANSWER MCQs, MULTIPLE-ANSWER MCQs, and TRUE/FALSE.
   - Favor single-answer questions (about 70–80%).
   - Multi-answer questions must list EACH correct answer separately.
   - Do NOT use “All of the above” or “None of the above.”

3. NUMBER OF QUESTIONS
   - Generate **3–5 quiz questions** for this section.
   - If the text supports 5 high-quality questions, generate 5.
   - If the text supports only 3 or 4 meaningful questions, generate 3 or 4.
   - Create exactly ONE additional “reserve” question for the final exam.
   - Total questions returned = 4–6, but exactly ONE must be marked as reserve.

4. OPTIONS
   - Options must be short.
   - Distractors must be plausible but incorrect.
   - Distractors must be built ONLY from nouns or concepts present in the text.
     (You may negate or modify them, but you cannot invent new nouns.)
